After reading [Domik Kress](https://github.com/Rotfuks): "GraphQL - Eine Einf√ºhrung in APIs mit GraphQL"  (english translation: "GraphQL - An introduction to APIs with GraphQL")
for the theory, I wanted to try it out practically with C#. I used this project to learn about setting up a GraphQL client, defining a schema, dataloaders, pagination, middleware,
queries and mutations, generating a client. It is built with the [ChilliCream](https://chillicream.com/) "ecosystem": [Hot Chocolate](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate/)
and [Strawberry Shake](https://chillicream.com/docs/strawberryshake).

This project uses session #1 - #6 from the [ChilliCream GraphQL workshop](https://github.com/ChilliCream/graphql-workshop) 
The client generation is based on the [Get Started Chapter](https://chillicream.com/docs/strawberryshake/get-started/console) from Strawberry Shake
